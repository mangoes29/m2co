            <p>We’re going to get right to it: job-costing in Quickbooks Online is possible in 2019, and it’s becoming easier than ever.</p>

<p>As a business owner or manager of any service business, whether that be a custom cabin builder, a painting and drywall company, local low voltage company, or a landscaping group, there has never been a better time to implement job costing in your business.</p>

<p>In fact, if you are not already do it - and your business is like any of the above - then let’s get you introduced to job costing, and why you need to be doing it in your service business.</p>

<h1>Quick Introduction to Job Costing</h1>
<h2>What is Job Costing?</h2>

<p>Job costing, easily defined, is allocating all costs in your business that are operational to a job/client/customer.</p>

<p>This practice is used in service businesses like painters, landscapers, general construction, industrial floor cleaning.</p>

<p>This style of accounting is also used in manufacturing, where inputs (raw materials) plus assembly costs are put towards 1 unit, usually by averaging out.</p>

<p>In our situation - service businesses - our main costs are labor and materials. 
So why should I do job costing?</p>

<p>The purpose of job costing in a service business is to find the profit or loss for each customer / job.</p>

<p>Why would you want to know this information, you ask?</p>

<p>With job costing, you are able to figure out questions like these:</p>

<p>What service are we provide that is the least or most profitable?
This shows you where to put your capital (money, people, trucks) to increase profits
Which of my employees is the most efficient? 
This allows you to help structure job crews, as well as learn from him/her on best practices to train others
What materials am I spending the most money on?
Shopping around for this material and knowing your volume can help lower your COGS
Where should I be allocating my marketing budget to drive revenue and profitability?
Knowing your most and least profitable departments, this choice becomes more clear.
Which are my most profitable customers?
I should pay extra attention and reward them so that they keep coming back!
Which project manager is hitting their budgets while running their jobs?
Which of my PM’s needs some more coaching to improve their output?
How do I get everyone on my team working towards the same goal?
If you are tracking profitability per job, maybe you create an incentive plan shared by your team?</p>

<p>The overarching emphasis is that job costing allows you to really understand your business’ operations so that you can make informed decisions. Without it, you’re essentially operating with a blindfold on.
What information do I need to job cost?</p>

<p>The inputs are - on paper - pretty simple.</p>

<p>In order to job-cost effectively, you need the Big Three Data Points:</p>

<blockquote>
Customers
Labor Costs per job
Material costs per job
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the rest of this article we are going to dive in to how you get this information from out there in the real world, in to Quickbooks Online, and then in to a format that gets you the information you need.</p>

<p>This takes some time to implement, but once up and rolling the process becomes second nature and is very much worth the investment of your time.</p>

<h1>Part 1: Customers, Classes, Locations - oh my!</h1>
<p>In Part 1, we are going to talk about the “Projects,” “Classes,” and “Locations” features in QBO. For each, we will run through what they are, why you want to use them, and how to get the feature turned on.</p>

<p>Lastly, for each setting, we’ll give an example of how to use the new feature with your business’ transactions.</p>
<h2>How to set up your customers for job costing in Quickbooks Online</h2>

<p>First thing we need to start job costing in Quickbooks Online is Customers! Below we will go through the best way to set up Customers for Job Costing.</p>

<p>This may seem basic, but it is the most important step in the setup of the entire process.</p>

<p>This is usually done by your team! Thus, it is essential that they are trained well and understand the “Why” behind operating in this way.</p>

<p>We are going to be using the ‘Projects’ setting in Quickbooks Online to track our job costs. It’s a relatively new feature, but it is safe to say that it will be here for a long time.</p>

<h2>What is the Project setting in Quickbooks Online</h2>

<p>The project setting in Quickbooks online allows the user (us!) to quickly be able to assign costs and revenues to a project (AKA Job), and then analyze the current status of that job financial via a quick and easy reporting dashboard.</p>

<p>Back in the day, this practice is what used to be called a “sub-customer” in QBO, but Projects is a more modern version that is more useful to us job-costers. 
Why you should use projects for customer tracking in QBO</p>

<p>Say you are running a landscaping company that does lawn mowing, snow removal, landscaping, and irrigation systems.</p>

<p>Your customer, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson (The Johnson’s)  have been great customers for a long time. They use all of your services.</p>

<p>In quickbooks, if you set them up as just one customer (The Johnson’s), and do not use project tracking, your job profitability report for the client will be such that every single cost &amp; revenue you assign to their account will be jumbled into one big pile.</p>

<p>So your irrigation system costs and revenue would combine with the snow removal numbers (hopefully these are not happening at the same time…), and what you would get is a profitability number that says:</p>

<p>“This is how much I make if I do an irrigation job and a snow removal job at the same time.”</p>

<p>Which, in the long run, is not much use to you.  You can certainly find this information if you need it (say - to have a special offering or sale), but you really want to know is the profitability of each of your individual services.</p>

<p>But - you may be thinking - what if I also want to know how much total business I did with The Johnson’s this year? I don’t want to have to add up every little thing in a spreadsheet to do that!</p>

<p>Lucky for you - once you are using the Projects setting correctly - you can do both! Easily!</p>

<p>We’ll cover the total customer Profit and Loss statement later when we jump into reporting.</p>

<p>See, what Projects really allows you to do is to get more specific with your financials on a per customer basis, allowing you greater clarity in decision making.</p>

<p>For example, you may want to know, and will be able to find: profitability by customer, profitability by service, profitability by service for just these customers, profitability by customers that do two/three/four of your services, profitability by customer location…us bookkeepers are just salivating at the idea of such granular data!</p>

<p>Let’s jump in to how we get this feature set up, and from there how it should be used correctly!</p>
<h2>How to set up Projects in Quickbooks Online</h2>
<p>Two parts to this: the setup, and then the execution. We’ll do the setup first. 
Side note: You must have the “Plus” or “Advanced” versios of QBO to do this.</p>

<p><strong>How to Turn on ‘Projects’ in QBO</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Gear Icon
<li>Click Settings
<li>Click Advanced
<li>Under the “Projects” sub-section, turn “Use Project Financial Tracking” to On. 
&lt;/ol&gt;


That’s it for turning things on. Side note: this is a permanent change. You cannot switch back. There is no risk for you here, though, as even though the Project setting is turned on, you do not have to use it. 


A very appealing warning screen!

You will know you are complete when you see this little new Projects guy on the left hand side of the screen. This area is essentially a projects Dashboard, where you can see the job cost overview of in-progress, completed, and deleted jobs. It’s a fantastic home base and easy-to-interpret interface for knowing the big question of “how’d we do on that job?”


How to Set up Customers using Projects in QBO

There are two types of customers (typically) in a service business: New Customers and Returning Customers. 

And we consider every “Project” done underneath the banner of that customer a “Job.”

So, if we have a New Job come through, we have two options: is this a New Customer, or a Returning Customer?

Let’s now go through how to handle both New Customer Jobs and Returning Customer Jobs in the Projects system.

How to set up a New Job with a New Customer with Projects

Go to the Sales Tab
Click “New Customer”
Fill in the New Customer’s name and information as usual
Click save
Now, under your new customer, click on the “Projects” tab
Add a new Project name
Click save
Now you have your new Customer and a New Projects

How to set up a New Job with a Returning Customer with Projects

Go to the Sales Tab
Use the search bar or scroll to your customer
Now, under your new customer, click on the “Projects” tab
Add a new Project name
Click save
Now you have your new Customer and a New Project

You are now all set and can start using projects. 

Your team’s job, now, is to assign transactions that are Job related to a certain “Project.”

These will go in to the “Customer” field of transactions



Pretty simple, but everything else going forward builds on this.
First Action / Go Do This:

Go in to Quickbooks Online and create a customer called “COMPANY.” This customer will be your default customer for Overhead expenses. The importance of this is discussed further on in the article.

You can also, for good experimentation, create a new Project under the COMPANY customer. 

Using Classes in Quickbooks Online: Why and How to do it right

Alrighty so we have our Projects turned on and our first COMPANY customer created - woohoo! Next up is creating the ability to slice and dice our financials even further, using classes.
What are Classes?

Think of a Class as a department in your business. If you are the landscaping company described above, your classes would look like this:

Example Classes of a Landscaping Company (we’ll call the company Lenny’s Landscaping)

Snow Removal
Lawn Mowing
Landscaping
Irrigation Systems
Administration (this is the department that helps run the company and keep it organized, running financials, handling compliance, and the ‘P’ work...payroll)

Breaking these down, we can start to see where our costs will go

Snow Removal
For all jobs that are for snow removal
Lawn Mowing
For all jobs that are Lawn Mowing
Landscaping
For all jobs that are Landscaping
Irrigation Systems
For all jobs that are for Irrigation systems
Administration
This is a general bucket for all expenses, aka NOT COGS
An example of this would be rent at an office building, or truck lease payments

Again, simple and easy, but is a powerful tool when used correctly.
Why should I set up “Class” tracking in QBO?

You want to set up Class tracking so that you can monitor an even more macro trend than your customer projects - so you can monitor profitability by department.

This is very useful, especially in the landscaping situation discussed earlier with their seasonal services, to help you allocate the correct resources. 

A lot of this information is in the founder’s and employees heads (which is exactly why many small business owners get in trouble...) but when you are looking at the numbers, you can really know what is going on. 

For example, let’s go back to our landscaping company. Say this is what revenue looks like during a 12 month cycle:

The data



But graphs are more fun.





Makes sense for a landscaping business. Big spike in work in the Summer while the weather is good. 

But, even more important, we want to be able to show when the demand comes in for his different services so that he can prepare his resources correctly. The break down by Class is below





Ok, so this shows us a lot more information. As the seasons change our revenue streams change, and the demand for different services changes. 

You’re probably thinking “Well yeah I know that, it’s my business” but here is how this information can help you make key business decisions: 

You can share this information with your team, letting them know exactly when the switch is coming
You can track revenues per department per year, which can help you set goals for next year
You will be able to see how many people you need for each service based on total labor hours, which will help with staffing forecasts.
You can see which services are growing, and which may be slowly dying
You are able to see which services are most profitable in general, and which services are least profitable

In all, adding Classes allows you an even further ability to analyze your  information. Knowing these things enables you to make the best decisions for your business capital and continue to grow into the future!

How to set up Class Tracking in Quickbooks Online

Below we go through how to set up Class Tracking in Quickbooks Online. 

Side note: You must have the “Plus” or “Advanced” versions of QBO to do this. 

Steps to Enable Class Tracking in QBO

Click the Gear Icon	
Click Company and Settings
Click Advanced
Under the “Categories” section, turn “Classes” to on
We would also highly recommend turning on reminders for if someone tries to create or import a transaction wihout a Class on each line item, as seen below
Lastly, know that the “Class” is non-posting. Aka it is not an official accounting function, jsut a sorting tool. It will never show up on external facing documents for customers or vendors. It only shows up in reports.


And now you’re locked and loaded for Classes.

How to Use Classes in QBO

Now that you are set up for class tracking, let’s run through a quick example of how to use this feature. 

Say that we are back at our irrigation company, and we have a Returning Customer who has a New Job. Let’s say this is a Combo job that our salesperson booked (Nice!) and we know that one invoice line item will be “Landscaping” and one will be “Irrigation.”

We set this up in projects, and are then going to create the first Invoice. 

Within the new Project, we select “New” then “Invoice.” We fill in all of the required information, and then we have a brand new section called ‘Class’ that shows up to the right of both the “Landscaping” and “Irrigation” line items.

This is where our new Classes feature comes in. We will simply jump in to that area, and select from a pre-set group of options for the different departments in our business. In our example, we would align the “Landscaping” invoice item with a “Landscaping” class, and the “Irrigation” line item with the “Irrigation” class. 

Oversimplification, yes, but that should show very cleanly what the class tracking function does. 

Now, it is your teams job to make sure this is done on every line item on every transaction. This seems like a hassle in the  beginning, but it will pay great dividends in the long run.


The Class must ALWAYS BE FILLED IN!
First Action:

So, to get started, we recommend right away going in and creating your Classes. It’s very simple. 

How to Create Your Companies’ Classes in Quickbooks Online

Click the Gear Button
Under “Lists,” click the link for “All Lists.”
Click Classes
Click ‘New’ To Add a class
Repeat until all of your classes are put in.
Add in an Administration Class for non-operational (Overhead) expenses

To get a sense of what this can look like, take a look at this diagram. 

For this client, which is a Youth Sports Training Club, we use a main class of “Sport”, then a sub-class of “Gender”, then a sub class of “Gender” for each program/camp/clinic/etc.

This works well as the breakdown of these costs helps the company track what areas are the most profitable, and can anticipate what upcoming services (camps, teams, tournaments) will look like on an P&amp;L.
Bonus: Location, Location, Location...
What is the Location Feature in Quickbooks Online?

Locations are another labeling option available in Quickbooks that helps you track in which occurrence of your business a transaction happened. 

Say you are the lawn care company we have explained above. Now, let’s say that this Lawn Care Company is based out of Nebraska. Nebraska is the location.

They have customers, classes and everything is fine in Nebraska, but now they want to move in to Iowa too. 

Instead of having to redo everything or run a new set of books for Iowa, they can now just ‘enable locations’ and boom, in 10 seconds their admin team has the ability to also hand the Iowa transactions from their home base in Nebraska. 

Pretty cool. 

Why use Location settings in Quickbooks Online

Enabling the Location setting gives you one more way to categorize your data. This can be helpful if, like the example above, you are going to try and replicate your business in another geographic location.

Another reason why you would want to enable Locations is because ‘Location’ can also be switched to any of the below labels as well. 

Business
Department
Division
Property
Store
Territory

So if you have say an “East Metro” (Location) and a “West Metro” (Location) Branch that do the same services (Classes). You could set up locations for that.

Or, you could also use this to track which Project Manager was on what job by using your PM’s as the “Location” or “Territory” option.

Or if you run a real estate business and want to look at profitability by unit type (Class) by property location (Location). Boom - that is doable.

Or - going even further - say you run a painting company with two services (Classes), and a landscaping company with four services (Classes), but all out of one office. 

What to do?

This is possible using the ‘Locations’, as you would just change the label to ‘Divisions’, and voila - you’re running two different types of businesses in one set of books, yet, you are able to analyze their performances separately.

The below table summarizes what that might look like:




Locations
Classes
Landscaping
Painting
Exterior Paint
n
y
Interior Paint
n
y
Design 
y
n
Contracting / Build
y
n
Sod
y
n
Weeding / Fertilization
y
n


If you put your mind to it you can really get some good information by using these tools. 
How to Use Locations in Your Business

Unlike classes and projects, each service business can have a different application of the Locations capability. 

I would recommend taking a look at this with your bookkeeper or accountant, and running it by your leadership team, and starting from there. 

If you are a small business in just one location, maybe you do not need to do this just yet - and that is fine - less work for you!

If you’re curious as to if locations would benefit you we’re always open for a free chat so you can just send us note as well.

Below are the steps to Enable Locations

Side note: You must have Quickbooks Online Plus or Advanced to do this

Enabling Locations in Quickbooks Online

Click the Gear Icon
Clik Account and Settings
Click “Advanced”
Under Categries, Turn Location to “On”

How to Add Locations to Your QBO Account

Click on the Gear Icon
Under “Lists,” click on “All Lists”
Click on Locations
Click “New” and add your locations

One final note on Classes and Locations: You get up to 40 combined Classes and Locations total in the “Plus” version before having to transition to “Advanced.” But! You can make old classes “Inactive,” and then they will be removed from your “Active” list, leaving you with more space.


Bada-bing-bada-boom you are now rolling with Projects, Classes, and maybe even Locations! Congratulations! 

Part 2: Capturing Material Costs
What are Material Costs
Quick and simple, material costs are any materials that you use to perform your service. 

Say you are building a deck, that would be lumber and fasteners.

If you are painting a house, you would say that paint brushes, paint, and rollers are your costs. 
In our businesses, these costs are simple to see, so we do not need to jump into further detail.

The Difference Between Bills and Expenses in Quickbooks

Quickbooks has two ways to classify transactions of money leaving the business that are allocated towards a job: the Expense and the Bill.

The “Expense”

 An Expense is when you buy something right then and there. 

Say that your guys drove three hours to a job and forgot a step ladder that they now need, and now they’re going to Home Depot to buy one. That is an expense. That you are most likely not happy about…

The “Bill”

A “Bill” is a product or service you have already received, with the intent for the company to pay the vendor at a later date.

Easy example: you are a General contractor doing a remodeling job. You have a drywall company come through and do the work, and your agreement with them is payment Net 30 from job completion. That’s a Bill.
Why Track Material Costs?

If you have been following along so far, this is an easy one! 

The reason to track material costs is to be able to get true profitability at a job by job level.

This enables us to really see how much we make per job. 

But also! When done correctly, you can see where your materials are going by department, and work to find better suppliers or terms for the purchases you make. 

Having the ability to say “We spent $465,000 on lumber as a business las tyera and are looking for a dedicated partner to be our primary supplier” can have a powerful effect on your leverage in that negotiation.

So, below we will look at How to Track material costs, which is a little more involved and takes some outside help to get done quickly and efficiently.

How to Track Material Costs to a Job in Quickbooks Online
In its most basic form, and if you have already completed Part 1, you can simply just make sure that the Job, Class, and Location (if you are doing locations) are filled in on every line item that comes in to your Accounting system. 


Example of a filled in Expense Transaction Line

But….how do my transactions even get in to Quickbooks Online!

There are a couple ways to look at this here. We cannot go fully in depth on each one, but with adequate googling (or by working with a trusted partner), you’ll be up and going no problem.

Three Ways to Get Transactions in to Quickbooks Online
Option #1: Manually Enter Everything

Quite simply you do not want to do this.

The main instance when you want to add something manually is with an Estimate or an Invoice to a client.

All Expenses should come in from the source (Checking Account, Credit Card, Vendor Account), which is discussed below…

Option #2: Use Bank Feeds to Get Information Straight From the Source

This is a very easy option that everyone can do. 

What happens is that Quickbooks talks to the Credit Card or Banking company, and pulls in the transactions from that institution directly into your bank feed. 

The Bank Feed brings in the Date, Amount, and a GUESS of who the vendor was. 

Then you look at the transactions and approved them.

This is WAY BETTER than option 1! But, there are also some flaws. 

Some sharp-witted readers may have noticed the word GUESS is accented above. Well that is a flaw because the software is not always right!

You cannot rely on Quickbooks to always get the vendor correctly. 

Secondly, if you are following along from Part 1 of this tutorial, what are we missing from those transactions?

If you guessed a Customer, Class, or Location, then you are correct!

Now what you end up having to do is go and chase down receipts from users, figure out the Customer and Class, and then go back in to Quickbooks and upload the Expense or Bill at the appropriate Vendor, then you have to go back again to the banking screen to match the Bank Account Transaction to the newly created expense. 

If you started getting a headache midway through that last paragraph, then you are not alone my friend….

Which brings us to our next choice:

Option 3: Use Distributed Software to Capture Data 

This is where we start using modern technology to create distributed accountability for material expenses. 

These tools work very simply: users make transactions, they send the documentation to the software, then the software pulls all available information like Date, Vendor, Amount, etc., then the software syncs the data into Quickbooks. 

These tools, when used correctly, can save incredible amounts of time to process expenses and bills as opposed to Option 2. 

For using the distributed Software, we would recommend the following options:

For Expenses, use Expensify

Again, an Expense in Quickbooks is a transaction where payment and goods/services are exchanged all at once. 

This means a receipt is generated straight away. 

With Expensify, you put the accountability of expense tracking onto the user of the Credit Card. 

This is much better than centralizing the task onto one Administrator, as one Administrator can be sick, can leave the company, and can then hoard all the company information.

Here is the link to the Expensify tool. If you need help setting it up, they have a useful documentation guide, or you could take a look at using our [INSERT GUIDE HERE #FILL] for complete instructions.

For Bills, use Bill.com

These guys really hit the jackpot on the names!

Bills, as discussed before, are goods or services received, with the intent to pay at a later day. 

Usually you are sent a bill from your vendor for these, and then you are obligated by a certain due Date. 

Bill.com works similarly to Expensify; vendors send bills to your Bill.com account, Bill.com reads and pulls all information it can (Date, Vendor, Bill #, PO#, etc.), one of your team members adds the job and confirms that all the information is correct, and then you one-click export to your accounting software. 

You can take a further look and Trial Bill.com here. 

While we do not have a certified “Using BIll.com in Your Service Business” guide at this time, it is in development, and for now we would recommend the following resources to get set up and rolling. 

#Fill

And that is is! If you are going to be doing this work yourself, we higly recommend option #3. If you read all of that and said to yourself, “Self, that seems like a heck of a lot of work that I am not too keen to do” let’s take a look at our last alternative:

Option 4: Work With Us!

Here at M2CO, we specialize in one thing: Done For You Job Costing for Service Businesses. 

Implementing and managing software tools to streamline the collection, documentation, and processing of material and expense data for Job Costing is all we do.

Our promise is that your financials will be more accurate than ever before, and you will spend less money than hiring a traditional in-house bookkeeper. 

You can get in touch with us here. We’d love to work with you. 

If you have an already established team and just want help with implementation and training, we can assist with that as well. 

And now, onto our last Data Point we need to collect: Labor Costs!
Part 3: Capturing Labor Costs
What are Labor Costs for Job Costing

For our situation, I want to first set the expectation that when talking about labor we are talking about these employees at your business:

“Those who are working hourly directly on the production of jobs.”

So, if you run a painting company, this is the painters and job site managers. Not the administrator answering phones.

Ok, on to Labor Costs.

In the most basic sense, Labor costs are the following: 

Employee hours worked X Cost/hour = Total Labor Cost

Say I am painting your house. I charge you $30/hour and it takes me 10 hours. That’s labor cost - at the most basic level - will be (30x10) = $300

But, as easy and wonderful as that situation sounds, there are hidden costs lurking beneath…..and this is known as the Labor Burden. 

In short, yoru costs per hour on an employee are not correct if you are only talking about their hourly wage. You must also consider PTO, Vehicle Costs, Company Tool Costs, Healthcare, Retirement Contributions, etc. etc. 
Implementing this number into your Quickbooks Online system effectively is another beast of its own, and will be tackled in a future post. For now, collecting accurate labor hours per job is our first step.
Why you Need to Track Labor Hours per Job

Being one of our Big Three Data points, Labor Cost per job is a must to know really start knowing your numbers.

Once you have your labor burdens properly allocated and are in the position to analyze them you can figure out:

Can I afford to add another employee to a certain division?
Am I pricing my labor correctly to hit my gross margin goals?
Should I subcontract or hire in house to do get this next set of jobs done?

And that is just a start. 

Again, the reason why you need to track labor burdens on hourly staff is that if you are not, then you really are not getting the correct numbers on your profitability, and any of your planning (say you want to open a new division next year and are putting together a cash flow proposal) will be incorrect!

In this Guide we start with just getting the labor hours correctly allocated on a per job basis. Job costing the labor Burden is itself a separate Guide that is coming soon. 

So, let’s take a look at how we get these accurate costs from the field into our books.
How to Track Labor Hour Per Job 

Just like tracking our materials, the best way to track Labor Costs in Quickbooks is to use Distributed software.. 

These software tools are quick and easy and allow employees to clock in and clock out of jobs from their cell phones. That is the essential piece. They also integrate to quickbooks so you can sync your data into the system no problem. 

Below are three different tools you can use to get the job costed labor hours for your business.

T-Sheets

T-sheets is the biggest player on the Quickbooks Online platform, mainly because they are also owned by Intuit, who owns Quickbooks. 
They have a nice scheduling feature as well as the easy clock-in and clock-out feature for the team. The data syncs with quickbooks and makes running payroll much easier. 

Along with that, the software can handle PTO requests, scheduling changes, and more features of the payroll function. 

When I Work

When I Work is very similar to T-Sheets. You are able to schedule your team and your staff are able to punch in and punch out on jobs. 

One additional feature on When I Work is that there is inter-app communication and you can also schedule tasks to be completed. This is a bonus when you have a project and want to make sure there is accountability for completion of certain tasks. 

Busy Busy

This tool was created by members of the construction industry, and has some worthwhile extra perks that may make it the best choice for you. 

While the app does have the main Punch in Punch out feature, the app also allows for in-app communication on jobs, your staff can add photos to jobs, your staff can add comments to a job as they go along, and you can track your equipment. 

If you operate a business that also works with heavy equipment, then this is probably your best choice for job costing labor, as well as the other great perks to stay organized. 

Once you are aup and running with a labor tracking system, allocating the costs to each job in Quickbooks is a matter of making sure that the costs that hit your bank account from payroll are ‘Split’ correctly to hit each job and class appropriately. 

If done through Quickbooks Payroll this is quite simple, as the data is already in QBO. If you do this through an outside provider like ADP or Paychex, then this will take a little spreadsheet magic, but is easy to implement once the system is in place.

Part 4: Job Costing Reports
Now you are able to see the fruits of your labor using the Reporting functions in Quickbooks to quickly and easily see your Profitability in action. 
Reports to Use in Quickbooks for Job Costing
Quickbooks gives you a wide variety of reports to use, but for our purposes there are a special few that we want to take a look at. 
The Projects Dashboard 
As we saw above, a quick look at the projects dashboard can bring us a wealth of information in no time. 

This is a great way to see the overall look of how your production is going on a job-by-job basis. 

Side note: make sure that when a job is completed you move it from “In Progress” to “Completed”


Profit and Loss by Class

This will show us the end result of using the Class functionality and putting that designation on every transaction. 

Another thing to know about these reports is how Quickbooks presents the data. 

If you remember our Youth Sports Training Organization from above, their ‘Hockey’ Class is set up as follows:

So the top level is “Hockey” then the first sublevel is “Boys / Girls” and then there is a Class for the Girls Hockey Fall Camp. 

Well, below you can see how this comes out in Quickbooks “Profitability by Class” report



It does a full breakdown from the top levels to the more granular going from left to right, then totals up the sub-classes and eventually the master class totals. It is a little weird, and you may want to do some editing in Excel before presenting with the team. 

Also, you can see there is no option for Boys Hockey in this screenshot. That is because Quickbooks will omit classes with zero transactions assigned during that time period. 

The last thing you could do with this report is save a customization of the report by “Location.” 

This way you can automatically pull up your Profitability by Class Report for one of your locations quickly and easily.

Sales by Class Detail
This report will allow you to see the sales numbers by class, and will list out all the customers. 

You may have to enable the “Customers” column to be added to the report, but then you will be able to see used which of your services. 

You can then use the data from this report, along with the “Member Contact List” report to create specific marketing campaigns or promotions for previous clients. 

Final Note: Send Reports Automatically
As a last comment on reports, once you figure out what reports that you and your management team have decided are most important, you can have them sent out automatically! 

This is a great feature so that your team is getting the information they need, and nobody is able to forget to send out the reports. 

Here are the steps:

Open the report you want to send automatically
Click “Save Customization” 
Add the Report to a Report Group (they work just like sub-classes) if you would like
Share With all the other users you want to be able to see this Report
Click “Save”
Click on the big Reports link on the left side of the screen
At the top click on “Custom Reports”
Find the report you just saved, and click “Edit” 
Scroll to the bottom of the next page and click the button to turn Scheduled Email to “On”
Add in the sender information, time, date. Frequency, etc., to your specifications

Click Save
Conclusion

If you have made it this far then great work! Going through so much bookkeeping work is tough and - let’s be honest - not the most thrilling of tasks. 

But, once these systems are in place, you will be job costing going forward into the future, and you will be able to reap the benefits of truly knowing your numbers.

While job-costing may take you some time to implement with your team, once you are up and running you will be able to have real clarity in your numbers, helping you increase profits in your business.

And lastly before we go, if you have any questions we would be happy to answer them! Please just post below. 

Best of luck and have fun job costing!
